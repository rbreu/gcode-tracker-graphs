Prerequisites:
==============

Python >= 2.6
Matplotlib
The Gcode python API

Usage:
======

Copy gcode_tracker_graphs_conf.py to ~/.gcode_tracker_graphs.conf
and modify it accordingly. It should contain one section (dictionary)
per Gcode project you want to use.

Execute:

gcode_tracker_graphs.py myproject

The program will cache the issue info per project in 

~/.gcode_tracker_graphs.sqlite

Remove that file if you want to start fresh.
